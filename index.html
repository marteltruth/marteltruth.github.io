We have choices to make. <br>
Doing nothing is a choice.

We removed the page previously hosted here because we received word that we would be punished by a university agent <br>
  for sharing this information, not because we don't stand by it. Additionally, we <br>
  decided that the survivors involved deserved better than to have to watch their struggle be reacted to across the college. <br>
  We are still listening to the previously posted email address. Remember that if you email us anonymously, we can't respond.
